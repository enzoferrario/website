        <h2>Games</h2>
        <li>Video Games</li>
          <p>
            I have been playing video games since I was very young.
            The first game I remember playing is Super Mario Brothers 3 on my uncle's NES.
            Since then, I have always had a knack for them.
            They have given me countless memories both with friends and by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            My top 5 favorite video games are:
            Celeste, Mirror's Edge (series), Outlast (series), Portal (series), and Danganronpa (series).
          </p>
        <li>Board Games</li>
          <p>
            I have always loved playing board games and cards and other similar forms of entertainment.
            Mainly, I play cards, however I love to play anything and am open to new games to play.
            I have a large history of board games and I don't think I would be able to pick a favorite.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a fairly large collection of playing cards.
            Cards are, to me, a perfect tool. There are an endless amount of things you can do with a single deck of cards.
            Group games, solo games, tricks, magic, flourishes, even just using it as something to fidget with, it can do more than most people think.
          </p>
        <li>Tabletop Games</li>
          <p>
            Tabletop games are a slippery slope.
            It's another step up from board games and people tend to lose
            intrest in these fast.
            I admitedly haven't played too many,
            however I always appreciate the chance to learn a new one.
            I suppose you could consider board games tabletop games,
            but for the sake of separation, I am considering tabletop
            games similar to Dungeons and Dragons, Settler's of Catan, or Twilight Imperium.
            Games that tend to take a long time and are generally
            considered games for geeks.
          </p>
        <li>D&D</li>
          <p>
            I have to thank Dungeons and Dragons because in my group of frieds that met at college, it gave us a ground to work off of.
            New players were able to learn the game through experienced players and eventually we were all able to hold our own.
            It gave me something to look forward to and something we could bond over. I would almost certainly consider it my favorite physical game.

        <h2>Psychology</h2>
        <p>
          One of the things I like learning about is the human mind and how it works on the inside.
          The brain is incredible and research has shown that there are still interesting
          concepts that can be researched today.
          Specifically, I enjoy human behavior and analysis of the mind.
          Humans are really weird in how we act.
          A lot of the time, humans follow the same patterns as each other.
          Same habits, same line of thinking,
          generally a lot is the same with most people.
          Both passively and actively, the mind is great for observation.
          For example, most people tend to look at people's eyes when their
          walking through a crowd. If they see that someone is looking one way,
          the brain picks up 2 things:
          they don't see where I'm going and they are going that way,
          so we instictively get out of their way.
          The opposite is true as well.
          If, when you're walking through a crowd, you look straight ahead,
          people most of the time will let you pass.

        <h2>Parkour</h2>
        <p>
          I've always enjoyed playing sports, but none as much as parkour.
          Parkour as a hobby is attractive to be becaues it's so free and fluid.
          It's also attractive because it's never the same.
          In my own life, I don't do a whole lot of stylish parkour;
          I prefer to stick to freerunning.
          The difference between the two is that the goal of freerunning is to
          get from point A to point B as fast as you can in any way possible.
          Vaults, climbing, rolls, various mechanics are different than that of
          regular parkour. Freerunners make their own paths and sometimes
          even their own movement.
          Its a lot of fun to do myself and to teach the basics to others. They
          seem to enjoy what I teach.

        <h2>Comedy</h2>
        <p>
          Less of a hobby, more of an important part of me.
          I believe that the ability to joke and the ability to take a
          joke is the most important part of life.
          If you take life too seriously, you are never going to enjoy it.
          You will be worked up all the time for seemingly no reason, and it
          is going to be a lot to handle.
          A sense of humor will give you the ability to see life through a
          much lighter lens and allow you to relax and destress.
          One ability that I needed to learn when I was younger was being able
          to laugh at myself. Life was stressful for me at a young age because
          I was so strung up.
          If anything was said about me, complimentary or not, it would bother
          me and I would get sad. If I made the smallest mistake, I would begin to cry.
          Since then, I grew a lot and learned that it's ok to laugh and it's
          ok to make people laugh. Laughter is the best medicine, as they say.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy making people smile as well.
          Seeing them happy because of something I said or did brings me a lot of joy.
          And I can't expect people to laugh at every joke that I tell,
          and thats ok. I'm my own biggest fan and if other people laugh with me,
          I consider that a bonus.
